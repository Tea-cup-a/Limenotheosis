*To climb the divine ladder is to remake yourself in the image of your miracle.  
The closer you get, the more you must leave behind.

### Divine Ascension: The Progression

There are 7 Tiers of Divinity, from T1 to T7.

Each tier represents a miracle—a transformation of spirit, body, or will. Every tier invites greater catastrophe, but also unlocks powers needed to survive what comes next.

Ascension isn’t automatic. It is earned by completing personal narrative agendas—unique quests or trials shaped around each character’s beliefs and burdens. These will be detailed further in Segment 6: Divine Ascension.

### Tier 0: The Spark

At Session 0, each character begins at Tier 0 (T0)—a mortal standing at the edge of ruin. During character creation, players define:

- The catastrophe that follows them  
- The miracle they seek to master      
- Their strengths and weaknesses  
- Their tenets (what they live for, fight for, and would die for)  
- Their motivation (what they pursue and what they flee)  

By the end of Session 0, they reach Tier 1 (T1) and gain their first miracle—a one-word divine expression (e.g., “Silence,” “Bloom,” “Burn”) that defines the shape and tone of their power.

---
### T1–T4: Experience and Ingredients

From T1 to T4, players ascend by gathering:

- Experience (XP) – a measure of alignment with their humanity  
- Ingredients – rare and symbolic items needed to craft a “recipe for disaster” 

---
#### Gaining Experience:

Each session, answer:

- Did I act in accordance with my tenets?  
- Did I act in accordance with my capabilities?  
- Did I move toward or away from my motivations?  

Gain 1 XP per “yes”.  
You may gain 2 XP for a “no,” but at the cost of 1 humanity.  
Given your tier, you can turn a number of XPs into Advances, and Advances can power up your character or tier up. 

---
#### Gathering Ingredients:

Chosen at Session 0, examples may include:

- Mercury from a shattered compass  
- Lily of the Valley growing in ash  
- The Soul of a Glad-Sad Stranger  
- A Fleeting Miracle pulled from a dying hero  

Ingredients are narrative, symbolic, and tied to your journey. GMs may alter or add to them.

#### Ascension Requirements:

- T2: 2 xp, 2 ingredients  
- T3: 3 xp, 3 ingredients 
- T4: 4 xp, 4 ingredients  

Ascension can occur mid-session, mirroring the in-the-moment transformation of your character cracking, breaking, and then rising into their power.

---
### T5–T7: Rituals and Miracles

After T4, the miracle becomes too vast to simply “level up.” You must consume a new miracle and perform a ritual to contain it within yourself.

#### Rituals:

Each ritual is a multi-session event:

- Set up sessions: lay the groundwork: gathering, preparing, understanding.  
- Performance session: the moment of transcendence—an actual in-game rite where the new power is made real.  

#### Ritual Requirements:

- T5: 5 xp, 3 ingredients, 1-step ritual, 1 T5 miracle  
- T6: 6 xp, 2 ingredients, 2-step ritual, 1 T6 miracle  
- T7: 14 xp, 3-step ritual, 1 final miracle (Pinnacle)  

---
### Humanity as Currency

If a player cannot meet XP requirements, they may spend humanity to ascend.

- XP Substitution: Spend humanity equal to your current Tier per missing XP (e.g., 4 humanity for 1 XP at T4).  
- Miracle Substitution: A player may sacrifice a touchstone (driving force or capability) to replace a required miracle.  

However, ingredients and rituals cannot be bypassed.

---
### The Consequences of Ascension

As you rise in Tier of Divinity:
- You gain more powerful miracles, tailored jointly by player and GM      
- Your catastrophes escalate, both in scope and in personal devastation  
- Your humanity becomes more fragile, and the temptation to give it up grows stronger  

Not all players will ascend at the same pace. Some rise fast, burned by urgency. Others hold back, protecting what remains of their soul. This is by design. Divinity is asymmetric, personal, and dangerous.
