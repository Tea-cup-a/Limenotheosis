Miracles, and their wielders by extension, are thwarted by the Fractured World harshly, but never unfairly. Costs are the way the World keeps tally and strikes back equally and precisely. Costs directly affect your character with consequences once it tallies up to the threshold.
##### In Game: 
Some actions taken by your character will generate Costs. they are:
- Risky action: If the failure of this action will pose a direct threat to the character's wellbeing, physically, mentally, socially, or humanely.
- Hard action: If the action touches upon one, if not multiple of the character's weaknesses, fears, or the character's own tenets. Or, 
- Impossible action: If the action requires a miracle to perform due to being well outside of the characterâ€™s defined limits. 

When these actions occur, you are asked to roll for Costs. The dice you roll equal to your current Karma count, AKA the pool of D10 that has been building through the game. 

The Dice reads like this: 
- For every 5 or below on a die, your action gains 1 Cost.
- For every pair of 10s, you generate 1 Drive, a shared party resource used to lessen costs.

Players can opt to fail, which then let's the story progress naturally with matching consequences. Or, players can succeed at a cost, knocking down costs according to their character.

To succeed at this costly action, players can utilize resources to lessen the impact, or prepare to pay the price and take on consequences. There are 4 main ways to take on the cost of action: 
- First, use your miracle to negate all costs for this action.
- Second, check the [Capabilities](Capabilities.md) of your character, see if any of your strength may help.
- Third, spend Drive from the party's share pool. Drive negate cost at a 1 to 1 ratio.
- Fourth, pay the cost by receiving [Damage (Trauma) WIP](Damage%20(Trauma)%20WIP.md).
