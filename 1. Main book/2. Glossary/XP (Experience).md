#### Gaining Experience:

Each session, answer:

- Did I act in accordance with my tenets?  
- Did I act in accordance with my capabilities?  
- Did I move toward or away from my motivations?  

Gain 1 XP per “yes”.  
You may gain 2 XP for a “no,” but at the cost of 1 humanity.  
Given your tier, you can turn a number of XPs into Advances, and Advances can power up your character or tier up.
