Damage is the game's way of determining consequences and harm that may befell your character. Damage goes beyond just physical damage, such as cuts, bruises, and injuries. It also identity related changes for the worst, and even supernatural consequences such as greater catastrophe, or losing your humanity. 

The game offers 2 types of Damage and 2 types of Trauma below:
	- Sublimation: You overreach into your miracles and cause an explosive cosmic imbalance, which invites your catastrophe closer, or creates a new disaster.
	- Crystallization: You slowly lose grasp of your humanity and become an existence of pure miracle, synonymous with being a walking catastrophe. 
	- Erasure: all injuries and afflictions upon the body and mind. Defects, damages, conditions and scars all belong in this category. 
	- Denial: all identity-related trauma, forcing you to confront your identity and risk losing parts of yourself. 
##### In Game: 
During the game, there are sometimes consequences associated with player action, specifically if the actions fail. These consequences via failure will result in Damage (Trauma) determined by the GM. It is influenced by the situation, the action, and will immediately fall upon the character.

Another way for characters to receive consequences are if players decide to succeed at a cost. Each cost fills up a gauge before resulting in Damage (Trauma). At 1, 2, or 3 costs, the consequences only looms over you. The last cost tips the gauge over, and results in Damage.

Mechanically, Damage and Trauma looks like this:
- Sublimation: Immediately gain an omen, elaborated further below. 
- Crystallization: Lose humanity equal to the current Divinity Tier. 
- Erasure: Gain an injury or condition, forcing additional circumstantial die.
- Denial: Choose one of the following: Extremify a tenet (narrow the scope, increase the scale, etc), remove a desire, add a fear, remove a strength, or add a weakness.
