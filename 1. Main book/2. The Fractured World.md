### How does the World work? 
* No fixed timelines
* No fixed locations
* Example of worlds within the Fractured
* The Impossible Pathways 
### How much should I know?
* No two worlds are the same
* Player created Microcosm
* Retrospective creation 
* Internal consistency and suspension of disbelief
### The Three Realms:

*The world fractured. Then heavens rose. And hell sank.*

In the beginning, there was only one world: a singular, struggling world. A world that bore the weight of belief, hope, despair, and power. Then came miracles, and with them, catastrophes. And in time, the world split apart, not along physical borders, but along metaphysical thresholds. The spheres that had a protector has risen beyond mortal reach, the places exploited and ruined fell into disastrous conditions, and whatever remained continued their struggles.

Each realm now reflects the extremes of what humanity brought forth into the world: suffering, salvation, and survival. None is heaven. None is hell. But we call them such because naming the unknowable is the only way we can try to understand it.

#### "Hell" – The Sunken Places

Hell is not a place of eternal torment in fire and brimstone. It is worse.

It is a name given to the ruins that once were part of the world: cities, temples, islands, entire civilizations. Now, they’ve sunken, metaphysically, and sometimes physically, beneath the weight of unchecked catastrophe. These are places where heroes failed, or worse, places where too many miracles compounded until the world itself snapped.

A “sunken place” cannot be entered by human means. They exist behind the veil of ruin, in pockets of collapsed reality. Only those touched by the divine: heroes, monsters, zealots, or something in between, can cross over into these wreckages. Some sunken places still harbor life, though twisted. The creatures and people that remain are either fragments of catastrophe or souls bound to a miracle strong enough to resist total erasure.

And then there are the truly abandoned places. Hollowed-out shells where only monsters linger, echoes of catastrophe with no meaning, no purpose, only hunger and endless ruin. Some dare to explore them in search of power. Fewer return. But within every sunken place lies a miracle, buried beneath ruin and waiting to be unearthed.

#### "Heaven" – The Sanctioned Paradise

Heaven is a name whispered bitterly or reverently, depending on who you ask. It is not the paradise of divine favour, but a constructed sanctuary, a fortified miracle crafted by human hands through suffering, sacrifice, and zealotry. These paradises float above the fractured world like gardened cities. They are built by powerful individuals who once sought to protect the world, and in doing so, created islands of sanctuary sustained by their own divinity.

Faith here is not metaphorical. It is literal fuel. The civilians. men, women, and children who survive inside these enclaves are part of the miracle itself. Their faith feeds the structure. Their obedience stabilizes it. Their reverence is not just cultural; it is foundational.

Each Heaven is ruled or protected by a central figure, a god to their people, a heretic to outsiders. Lesser beings who serve and protect are called angels. Some are born divine, others are forged in the crucible of belief. At the base of it all are saints, believers granted slivers of the divine to act as extensions of the miracle’s will.

Heavens are not without struggle. They are militarized. Soldiers fight not for conquest, but to preserve the miracle from the catastrophes that rage beyond their borders. Though their walls stand tall, disaster lurks in every shadowed corner inside the gates, and monsters wait for their moment.

#### The Fractured – The Broken In Between

What of the rest of the world? It remains fractured, scorched, bleeding, but breathing still.

This is where most living being clings on. In between the sunken hells and the guarded heavens, there is life: desperate, defiant, ordinary life. The Fractured is littered with half-ruined cities, poisoned forests, broken machines, and haphazard shelters built from the bones of miracles past. Every region exists in the shadow of a catastrophe not yet unleashed or a miracle whose foundations may yet crumble.

Some say The Fractured is the battlefield. Others say it is the proving ground. But for the ones who live here, it is simply home. They are not believers, not zealots. Most are not even survivors in any heroic sense. They are the dregs and dreamers who refuse to ascend and fear to sink.

They scavenge, barter, and pray. They worship lesser-known saints, not because they believe, but because desperation demands hope. When heroes come, when miracles are performed, when ruins are purified, when disasters are turned back, they cheer. Not because they cherish those who bears divinity but because the smallest flame can offer them some warmth.

But every miracle they witness, every salvation they cling to, draws catastrophe closer. The Fractured gains its name because it has always borne the full weight of that paradox: to live is to hope, to hope is to invite miracles, and miracles invite ruin.

### Origins:

*The gift of resilience triumph no matter the situation.*

As the world broke apart, fragments of what use to be whole became their new specialized home. Whether be it ascended paradise or impossible barren wastelands, life finds a way. Realms differ in their special ways, belonging to different gods, harboring different disasters, honoring different traditions, but most have a generalized archetypical perception attached to them. 

There are four broad categories dividing the people of the Fractured World, they're origins that may inform you of their backgrounds and traditions.
##### Hellborn: The Need to Survive

As the name suggests, there are those who live in the depths of sunken places claimed by catastrophe. Whether you are claimed by hell or born into it, your experiences give you an uncanny aptitude towards surviving or escaping disasters that rear their head at you. Though only a colloquial name given to all those associated with living in these disastrous places, it nevertheless caught up amongst the grapevines in the fractured earth. 

However, being a hellborn doesn’t make you any more or less corruptible than the rest of the world, nor does it suggest anything of your virtue or character. Though the perception of other folks of you would inform you that this knowledge is not shared with everyone. Hellborns are often seen with prejudice, mistrust, and fear due to their origins. Despite their reputation for great disaster survivors, they often bore the blame for disasters in the first place. 
##### Heavenkin: Faith and blindness

Similar to how hell and heaven are colloquial names, heavenkin is also only a title for all those living in a protected sanctuary. Being in these domains, you worried less of primitive struggles such as safety and survival, but more of the intricate theocratic society you inhabited. You are apt in dealing with the inner workings of abstract plans and compromise, even more so within divine domains. Depending on the domain, you also have specific skills from your history. 

As all heavenkin have a duty to uphold their faith wherever they go, you have a name and impression to uphold. Though even if you try to blend in, anything that gives away your identity may instead warrant you unwanted attention, positive and negative. Naivety, zealotry, stubbornness, and pridefulness are just some of the words folks would label you with, and even worse if they suspect you to be the sign of an oncoming crusade against nearby heavens or hells. 
##### Kindreds: Searching for Purpose

The elevated and sunken places affect more than just those who are born and live within, but also everything around. There are those left with no identity and no meaning as drastic changes happen to them, and their lives are taken without warning. Kindreds are lost souls abominable to this world. Their origin is a mystery, rumored and ridiculed by all who observe them, but none are more curious about who they are than themselves. Fragmented memories, interesting tattletales, or perhaps a world that was once so familiar, but now their own face looks strange in the mirror. 

Kindreds are free souls, but they would rather be anything but. Searching for a meaning and finding out who they are or what they are all about is all they do. 
##### Fractures: Living in Defiance 

* The folks living in the Fractured, nomadic, distrusting, may either be tribal or individual.

### Specializations: 

*Well, what are you gonna do. Once the crusades are done and the disaster blows over, you still gotta work, gotta eat, and gotta live.*

To live in this vengeful world, you can't not have a skill or two in your back pocket that makes you standout. In the tumultuous world where your continent could change climate over night, you have to have some skill that not only keeps you alive, but thriving. 

Specializations are the last corner piece in helping people identify each other, sometimes even more so than the Origins of individuals. Communities often see a variety of skills keeping each other thriving, and those traveling solo will often meet and greet others of similar situations. 

Specializations can be defined into two broad types, Traits and Knowledges.
- Traits: Naturalized area of expert skill expression. Whether be it natural born or acquired through practice and training, these help you gain an edge to survive. 
- Knowledge: Learned areas of necessary information, albeit sometimes specific and context specific, much of the knowledge can also be applied fluidly if given the right situation.
##### Specialization Examples: 
- Farmer: Able-bodied, Knowledge (botany)
- Alchemist: Dexterous, Knowledge (alchemy)
- Military General: Commanding, Knowledge (tactic)
- Engineer: Reparation, Knowledge (mechanic)
- Thief: Pick-pocketing, Knowledge (escape routes)
- Lone Survivor: Survival, Knowledge (signs of danger)
