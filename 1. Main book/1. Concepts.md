### Foreword

*“Hell is real, and we’re losing the war.”*

Not a metaphor. Not a myth whispered in taverns to frighten children. Hell is a tangible, corrupting reality pressing against the fabric of our world, its tendrils spreading relentlessly beneath our feet and in the shadows of ruined places. It is the embodiment of devastation, an ever-growing abyss swallowing hope, faith, and life itself.

*“As is Heaven, and we’re dying to drag them down with us.”*

Heaven is no imagined utopia either; it is real, but distant, fragile, and bleeding. Our desperate grasping for salvation claws at its gates, tearing at the divine walls built to protect. The angels tremble as humanity’s storms erode paradise. We pull Heaven into our chaos, dragging even the sacred into ruin.

*“The world had a balance, and we broke it. Now, the karmic balance threatens to restore itself, even if it means bringing itself down with us.”*

The Fractured is a battleground scorched by the eternal conflict between miracle and catastrophe. It is riddled with scars. Disasters lurking just beyond the horizon, waiting for the unwary. To many, the world is a place of dark omens and whispered prayers, where only a hero’s miracle can stave off the coming end.

*“What they don’t know, and will forever be kept a secret, is that every miracle invites a catastrophe.”*

But each miracle, born from a flicker of impossible hope, demands its due. Beneath every blessing lies a shadow, a reckoning waiting to be unleashed. Miracles do not come free; they shift the cosmic balance, and the universe demands repayment.

*“As long as a spark of miracle exists in this world, catastrophe will never cease to try to claim it.”*

This is the hidden truth, buried beneath centuries of bloodshed and whispered secrets. The delicate scales of existence once held steady, but humanity’s hunger fractured the equilibrium. Now the karmic forces move ceaselessly to heal the wound, no matter the cost.

Welcome to **Limenotheosis**, where salvation and destruction walk hand in hand. Every choice carves the fate of worlds, and the cost of power is always measured in lives and loss.

### Limenotheosis - Liminal gods (WIP)
#### What is this game? (Rewrite)
In Limenotheosis, players inhabit cursed heroes tethered to miracles they cannot abandon—and hunted by catastrophes they cannot escape. Every miracle they wield reshapes the world, and every act of divine will hastens its unraveling. 

You are not trying to become gods.  
You are already becoming them.  
The question is what you’ll break along the way.

##### Desperate Origins: The Setup
The game is structured so that players each come to the table with a story trope they wish to explore while playing their unlikely hero. The choices and consequences all serve to facilitate a fantastical quest of sacrifices and hard-earned victory. 

This game lacks a detailed combat structure and does not outline a clear path to success or failure. Instead, it offers an intentional choice every time that the players may fail at their action. Instead of rolling the dice to see whether you succeed or fail, you roll the dice to randomly determine the cost of the action and how much your character has to suffer to earn that victory. It is always the player’s decision to succeed at a price, or biting the failure and trying another time.  

Your story, as guided by the DM, will still revolve around your character. The game needs its heroes to function. This system recommends structuring the story around the personal struggle of each character, much like mythological legends of most cultures. The protagonist comes into the story with a self-driven goal already, and it is the DM/the storyteller’s job to provide obstacles that the players will choose to succeed or fail at.

The game recommends a session 0 to have out all the details regarding personal stories they wish to tell, and personal goals, no matter how big or small, to achieve. Session 0 will also be important for the players to provide the DM with specific details of the quest they will embark on, through a “recipe for disaster” they will develop together. More on that in later sections.

Lastly, within session 0, the character should have both an outlined goal as well as a personal Catastrophe. Catastrophe is defined as a doom that hunts them so long as they hold on to their miracle. This will serve as external motivation that threatens important and intrinsic parts of your character, so they will not give up. It is the reason they’ve awakened a miracle in the first place, and a great place to begin the narrative as the group as a whole discovers more story down the line.

##### Divine Escalation: The Core Story
Once the game begins, the characters will embark on the journey to achieve their goal and avoid their catastrophe by conquering many obstacles. To resist your catastrophe, you must seek greater miracles. This is the core paradox  at the heart of the game: the only way to survive your own unraveling is to climb higher into the divine and risk falling harder.

A typical story arc involves the journey of a character to achieve their personal desires through supernatural growth, but ultimately culminating in the  arrival of a major catastrophe—an unholy beast, a divine plague, or a reality-shattering event.

At the start of each arc, players should set a goal (or short term desire) their character wishes to achieve by the end of the arc, and typically should be resolved by pursuing activities below.

- Investigate a sunken place and uncover lost miracles (and the dangers within)  
- Bargain with a heavenly paradise, allying with or challenging divine powers  
- Explore neutral grounds to prepare, plan, or pursue unconventional solution.

The story revolves around three primary activities:
###### 1. Explore Hell. 
Descend into sunken places—landscapes unfit for mortal life, where catastrophe reigns. Here, you’ll uncover forgotten miracles, face abominations twisted by divine imbalance, and fight not to win, but to extract meaning. You do not walk into Hell for treasure. You walk into it to keep your own catastrophe at bay.
###### 2. Bargain with “Heaven.”
Heaven is no paradise. It is a walled garden upheld by suffering believers and miracle-fed order. In these artificial sanctuaries, you negotiate with zealots, angels, saints, and the gods who once were human like you. You seek allies, power, answers—but their peace has a price, and you may leave with more chains than blessings.
###### 3. Survive the Cracked Middle.
Earth, the middle realm, is fractured. Unprotected cities crumble. Outposts cling to hope. The people here are neither damned nor saved—they are exhausted, desperate, and watching the sky for miracles that only bring further catastrophe. Here, you make the hardest decisions: who to help, what to preserve, and what to sacrifice to see another light of day.

### Miracles and Catastrophes - The Law of Balance

In Limenotheosis, miracles are the sparks that light the darkness, and catastrophes are the shadows that chase them. They shape the fate of heroes, worlds, and gods alike.

Miracles are not divine gifts bestowed lightly or without consequence. They are the desperate acts of willpower against an uncaring cosmos. A spark of impossible light, forged from the wielder’s pain, hope, and resolve. 

Each miracle is a violation of the natural order, a rebellion against the world in its slow, inevitable decay. The universe demands balance for every miracle: a cost that is paid in sorrow, loss, or ruin. 

---
#### The Nature of Miracles

Miracles are deeply personal. They reflect the wielder’s history, desires, and inner strength. To some, a miracle is a gentle warmth that protects and heals; to others, a roaring flame that burns away obstacles and enemies. No two miracles are alike, for they are expressions of the soul itself.

Narratively, a miracle is the player’s declaration of “yes”—an act of defiance against the world’s inevitable decay. It is the moment when hope dares to bloom. But it is also a double-edged sword, for that “yes” comes at a price. Each miracle stretches the fabric of reality, bending rules, rewriting fate, and inviting unseen forces to react.

Mechanically, miracles allow players to bend the game world to their will. When a player calls upon a miracle, they rewrite outcomes, succeed where failure seemed certain, or alter the course of events against the GM’s design. But every such act manifests Karma and Omens, a cosmic balancing force that eventually returns as consequences.

---
#### The Nature of Catastrophes

Catastrophes are the mirror to miracles—the dark side of the coin. They are the inevitable reckoning, the universe’s attempt to set the scales right. For every blessing bestowed, a curse looms. For every life saved, another teeters on the brink.

Narratively, catastrophes are relentless, personal, and cruel. They twist and warp the world around the wielder, dragging them into shadows. Sometimes a catastrophe is a famine following a year of plenty. Sometimes it is a vengeful spirit unleashed after a healing miracle. Sometimes it is the shattering of a hero’s sanity.

Catastrophes are not always sudden or explosive. Often, they creep, building tension like a gathering storm, waiting for the right moment to strike. They are like the kingdom that lost the war, due to one missing horse nail. 

Mechanically, catastrophes manifest as major events or challenges designed to challenge the players and push the story forward. They may appear as monstrous foes, devastating plagues, or subtle curses that erode the party’s strength and resolve. The nature, scale, and timing of catastrophes are tightly bound to the character’s tier, actions, and choices.

---
#### Miracles and Catastrophes in the World

Miracles and catastrophes are not static. They can be:

- Transferred: A miracle can pass from one wielder to another, along with its shadow.
- Sealed: Miracles and catastrophes can be contained, locked away in sanctuaries or relics.
- Weaponized: Both forces can be turned into tools of war, bargaining chips in divine politics.
- Suppressed: In neutral zones—lands between Hell and Heaven—miracles and catastrophes may be hidden, ignored, or fought over fiercely.

This dynamic system ensures that power is never static, alliances shift constantly, and no one is safe from the relentless tide of balance.

---
#### The Eternal Dance: Bargaining and Dictating 

To survive the crushing weight of the world, players must learn to bargain. With the story, the GM, and their own losses.

Sometimes, inviting catastrophe early is a strategic choice—a sacrifice made for certain victory or to protect what matters most. Other times, players must choose to suffer failure or painful loss to delay the inevitable, buying precious time or safeguarding allies.

Though bargaining is the heart of tension in Limenotheosis, sometimes you simply wish to succeed in the story or outsmart the circumstance. Your miracle grants power—and each catastrophe threatens destruction. The wielder’s choices to dictate what happens in the moment will see consequences in the future, but at least it’s one choice in your control.

	* To defeat Catastrophe, because one can never personally fight it. 
	* Specialization, cooperation is how mortals and divines survived the Fractured World.

### The Not-Heroes (Rewrite needed)
You are not the chosen. Not blessed by destiny, not forged for glory. No prophecy speaks your name. No crowd sings your praise.

And yet, you bear a miracle.

It clings to you like fire, burning through the cracks of the world. Wherever you go, catastrophe follows.  

You didn’t choose this life. Maybe you found it as a desperate solution. Maybe it bore in you in your worst moment. However it came, it changed you, marked you, now it's impossible to ignore.

You cannot let it go. To let go is to rejected the world that's already warped to your will. The miracle is now forever molded by your history, and to keep this world the way it is now is all you've ever wanted. Not to mention the catastrophe that now stalks you, to abandon your miracle is to set ruin loose upon what you've created. 

And so you carry it, knowing it's gonna burns everyone around you.

You are not a savior.  
You are not a villain.  
You are a bearer of miracles.  

You act because no one else will. You fight, not for victory, but to keep the world from falling back into your worst nightmares. You endure because something still matters, even if no one else agree.

You are not the hero they wanted.  
But you’re the one the story won’t let go.

You are only the Hero of your own story.
