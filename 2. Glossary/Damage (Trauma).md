as detailed below.
	- Sublimation: You overreach into your miracles and cause an explosive cosmic imbalance, which creates a new disaster or invites a catastrophe closer.
	- Crystallization: You slowly lose grasp of your humanity and become an existence of pure miracle, synonymous with being a walking catastrophe. 
	- Erasure: all injuries and afflictions upon the body and mind. Defects, damages, and scars all belong in this category. 
	- Denial: all identity-related trauma, forcing you to confront your identity and risk losing parts of yourself. 

Each remaining cost contributes to these consequences and fills up a gauge before disaster falls. At 1, 2, or 3 costs in each consequence, disaster looms over you. Once the last cost point tips the gauge over, consequence falls accordingly.

- Sublimation: Immediately gain an omen, elaborated further below. 
- Crystallization: Lose humanity equal to the current Divinity Tier. 
- Erasure: Gain an injury or condition, forcing additional circumstantial die.
- Denial: Choose one of the following: Extremify a tenet (narrow the scope, increase the scale, etc), remove a desire, add a fear, remove a strength, or add a weakness.
