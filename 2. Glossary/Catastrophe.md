Within the setting of the Fractured World, Catastrophe is a counterbalancing force to the existence of Miracles. The World had always used Catastrophes to eliminate Miracles, and what people have created with Miracles. 

Catastrophes are the mirror to miracles—the dark side of the coin. They are the inevitable reckoning, the universe’s attempt to set the scales right. For every blessing bestowed, a curse looms. For every life saved, another teeters on the brink.

Narratively, catastrophes are relentless, personal, and cruel forces chasing any that wield a miracle. They twist and warp the world around the wielder, undoing whatever they've managed. Sometimes a catastrophe is a famine following a year of plenty created via a Miracle. Sometimes it is a vengeful spirit unleashed after miraculous healing. Sometimes it is the shattering of a hero’s sanity as they continue using and abusing their power.

Mechanically, catastrophes manifest as major events or challenges designed to challenge the players and push the story forward. They may appear as monstrous foes, devastating plagues, or subtle curses that erode the party’s strength and resolve. The nature, scale, and timing of catastrophes are tightly bound to the character’s tier, actions, and choices.

Catastrophes are not always sudden or explosive. Often, they creep, building tension like a gathering storm, waiting for the right moment to strike. They are like the kingdom that lost the war, due to one missing horse nail. 

The only way to fully avoid and eliminate a Catastrophe is to have destroyed the Miracle associated with it. Despite so, Catastrophes can be delayed, survived through, and quelled with strategic and intentional planning. This is one of the game's major source of motivation.
