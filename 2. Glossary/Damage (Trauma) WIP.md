Damage is the game's way of determining consequences and harm that may befell your character. Damage goes beyond just physical damage, such as cuts, bruises, and injuries. It also identity related changes for the worst, and even supernatural consequences such as greater catastrophe, or losing your humanity. 

The game offers 2 types of Damage and 2 types of Trauma below:
	- Sublimation: You overreach into your miracles and cause an explosive cosmic imbalance, which invites your catastrophe closer, or creates a new disaster.
	- Crystallization: You slowly lose grasp of your humanity and become an existence of pure miracle, synonymous with being a walking catastrophe. 
	- Erasure: all injuries and afflictions upon the body and mind. Defects, damages, conditions and scars all belong in this category. 
	- Denial: all identity-related trauma, forcing you to confront your identity and risk losing parts of yourself. 
##### In Game: 
During the game, there are sometimes costly actions 


Each remaining cost contributes to these consequences and fills up a gauge before disaster falls. At 1, 2, or 3 costs in each consequence, disaster looms over you. Once the last cost point tips the gauge over, consequence falls accordingly.

- Sublimation: Immediately gain an omen, elaborated further below. 
- Crystallization: Lose humanity equal to the current Divinity Tier. 
- Erasure: Gain an injury or condition, forcing additional circumstantial die.
- Denial: Choose one of the following: Extremify a tenet (narrow the scope, increase the scale, etc), remove a desire, add a fear, remove a strength, or add a weakness.
