A core concept to explore in Limenotheosis is Divinity. What it is, what it looks like, and what we can imagine/reimagine around it to create new stories. 

In contrast to Humanity, which we living as humans understand and interact with daily, Divinity often exist only in discrete and limited portrayal in fiction, religion, and pop culture.
