Divinity is a core concept that Limenotheosis aims to explore. What it is, what it looks like, and what we can imagine/reimagine around it to create new stories. 

Humanity may be the methods humans use to interact with the world, whether be it the "golden rule" of love thy neighbor as yourself, or "jungle rules" where strongest shall survive, all of it falls under still utilizing human efforts, human means, and human rationalization to interact with the world. It is something that we can understand and interact with daily living as humans.

In contrast, Divinity exist only in discrete and limited portrayal in fiction, religion, and pop culture. This system offers an attempt to encompass as many portrayals of Divinity as possible, and defines Divinity as "An alternative method to Humanity, from root thoughts to actionable behavior, in interactions with the world." 

Utilizing Divinity could be a different way to solve problem, a different perspective to look at situations, or entirely different understanding of how and why the world is. Though, this process requires suspension of your disbelief, as we humans may never have factual and correct interpretation of Divinity, only speculations and deep exploration.
