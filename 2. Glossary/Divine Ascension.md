Limenotheosis' progression system isn't a passive one. To progress and ascend, players and characters alike must intentionally chase the components involved in Divine Ascension. 

Each Tier has different components for Ascension, below is a quick reference: 
#### Tier 0: The Spark
At Session 0, each character begins at Tier 0 (T0)—a mortal standing at the edge of ruin. 

During character creation, players define:
- Their tenets (what they live for, fight for, and would die for)  
- Their motivation (what they pursue and what they flee)  
- Their strengths and weaknesses  
- The catalyst that surrounds them and pushes them into ruin
- The spark that awakened to solve their impossible task 

They will also semi-narratively play out this part of their history as they step into Divinity.

By the end of Session 0, they reach Tier 1 (T1) and gain their first miracle - a divine expression created in collaboration with their GM that defines the shape and tone of their power. 

This miracle can be abstract one word power, such as "bloom", "silence", "ember", etc. Or it can be more intuitive and conventional like "EMP", "Stretchy Arms", "invisibility".

#### T1–T4: Advances and Ingredients
From T1 to T4, players ascend by gathering:
- Advances – a measure of personal narrative progress, cashed out via their [[XP (Experience)]]
- Ingredients – rare and symbolic items needed to craft a “recipe for disaster” 

Ascension can and are encouraged to occur mid-session, mirroring the in-the-moment transformation of your character cracking, breaking, and then rising into their power.
##### Gathering Ingredients: (WIP)
Chosen at Session 0, examples may include:
- Magnet from a shattered compass  
- Lily of the Valley growing in ash  
- The Memories of a Stranger  
- A Fleeting Miracle pulled from a dying wielder
##### Ascension Requirements:
- T2: 1 Advance, 2 ingredients  
- T3: 1 Advance, 3 ingredients 
- T4: 1 Advance, 4 ingredients

#### T5–T7: Rituals and Miracles
Beyond T4, the miracles itself becomes too vast and heavy for the world alone to sustain its “level up.” You must consume other miracles, new or pre-existing, and perform a ritual to contain it within yourself.
##### Rituals: (WIP)
Each ritual is a multi-session event:
- Set up sessions: lay the groundwork: gathering, preparing, understanding.  
- Performance session: the moment of transcendence—an actual in-game rite where the new power is made real.  
##### Ritual Requirements:
- T5: 1 Advance, 3 ingredients, 1-step ritual, 1 T5 miracle  
- T6: 2 Advance, 2 ingredients, 2-step ritual, 1 T6 miracle  
- T7: 3 Advance, 3-step ritual, 1 final miracle (Pinnacle)

#### Humanity as Currency
If a player cannot meet Ascension requirements, but it is necessary to Ascend, players may sacrifice their Humanity and Touchstones to meet the requirements.

- Advancement Substitution: Spend humanity at a 1 to 1 ratio for XP.
- Miracle Substitution: Sacrifice a touchstone for each required miracle.  

Ingredients and Rituals, however, cannot be bypassed or substituted this way.
