Limenotheosis offers an intentional progression system. To progress and ascend, players and characters alike must intentionally chase the components involved in ascension. 

Each Tier has different components for Ascension, below is a quick reference: 
##### Tier 0: The Spark
At Session 0, each character begins at Tier 0 (T0)—a mortal standing at the edge of ruin. 

During character creation, players define:
- Their tenets (what they live for, fight for, and would die for)  
- Their motivation (what they pursue and what they flee)  
- Their strengths and weaknesses  
- The catalyst that surrounds them and pushes them into ruin
- The spark that awakened to solve their impossible task 

They will also semi-narratively play out this part of their history as they step into the worl

By the end of Session 0, they reach Tier 1 (T1) and gain their first miracle - a divine expression created in collaboration with their GM that defines the shape and tone of their power. 

This miracle can be abstract one word power, such as "bloom", "silence", "ember", etc. Or it can be more intuitive and conventional like "EMP", "Stretchy Arms", "invisibility".

### T1–T4: Experience and Ingredients

From T1 to T4, players ascend by gathering:

- Experience (XP) – a measure of alignment with their humanity  
- Ingredients – rare and symbolic items needed to craft a “recipe for disaster” 

---
#### Gaining Experience:

Each session, answer:

- Did I act in accordance with my tenets?  
- Did I act in accordance with my capabilities?  
- Did I move toward or away from my motivations?  

Gain 1 XP per “yes”.  
You may gain 2 XP for a “no,” but at the cost of 1 humanity.  
Given your tier, you can turn a number of XPs into Advances, and Advances can power up your character or tier up.

#### Gathering Ingredients:

Chosen at Session 0, examples may include:

- Mercury from a shattered compass  
- Lily of the Valley growing in ash  
- The Soul of a Glad-Sad Stranger  
- A Fleeting Miracle pulled from a dying hero  

Ingredients are narrative, symbolic, and tied to your journey. GMs may alter or add to them.

#### Ascension Requirements:

- T2: 2 xp, 2 ingredients  
- T3: 3 xp, 3 ingredients 
- T4: 4 xp, 4 ingredients  

Ascension can occur mid-session, mirroring the in-the-moment transformation of your character cracking, breaking, and then rising into their power.

### T5–T7: Rituals and Miracles

After T4, the miracle becomes too vast to simply “level up.” You must consume a new miracle and perform a ritual to contain it within yourself.

#### Rituals:

Each ritual is a multi-session event:

- Set up sessions: lay the groundwork: gathering, preparing, understanding.  
- Performance session: the moment of transcendence—an actual in-game rite where the new power is made real.  

#### Ritual Requirements:

- T5: 5 xp, 3 ingredients, 1-step ritual, 1 T5 miracle  
- T6: 6 xp, 2 ingredients, 2-step ritual, 1 T6 miracle  
- T7: 14 xp, 3-step ritual, 1 final miracle (Pinnacle)

### Humanity as Currency

If a player cannot meet XP requirements, they may spend humanity to ascend.

- XP Substitution: Spend humanity equal to your current Tier per missing XP (e.g., 4 humanity for 1 XP at T4).  
- Miracle Substitution: A player may sacrifice a touchstone (driving force or capability) to replace a required miracle.  

However, ingredients and rituals cannot be bypassed.
